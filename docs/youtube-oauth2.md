## Setting up

1. Enable `youtubeoauth2=true` in your `config.txt`.
    - You may already have `youtubeoauth2=false` somewhere in your config.
      If you do, you can replace `false` with `true`.
    - Otherwise, create a new line anywhere in your config with
      `youtubeoauth2=true`.

2. Restart JMusicBot.

3. JMusicBot will now send the following
   to the owner's direct messages and to the console:
    ```
    [INFO] [YoutubeOauth2Handler]: ==================================================

After the authorisation has completed, the following message should get logged
to the console a few seconds later:

`[INFO] [YoutubeOauth2TokenHandler]: Authorization successful & retrieved token! Storing the token in /path/to/jmusicbot/youtubetoken.txt`

JMusicBot is now signed in and will store the credentials
in a new `youtubetoken.txt` file. 

## Signing out

To sign out, manually delete the `youtubetoken.txt` and restart JMusicBot.

Additionally, you may want to go to
[Your Google Account -> Security -> See all connections](https://myaccount.google.com/connections)
to remove the "YouTube on TV" connection.
Note that this will also sign out any TV you were signed in to with that
Google account.

// Any line starting with // is ignored                //
// You MUST set the token and owner                    //

// This sets the token for the bot to log in with
// This MUST be a bot token (user tokens will not work)
// If you don't know how to get a bot token, please see the guide here:
// https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/wiki/Getting-a-Bot-Token

token = BOT_TOKEN_HERE


// This sets the owner of the bot
// This needs to be the owner's ID (a 17-18 digit number)
// https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/wiki/Finding-Your-User-ID

owner = 0 // OWNER ID


// This sets the prefix for the bot
// The prefix is used to control the commands
// If you use !!, the play command will be !!play
// If you do not set this, the prefix will be a mention of the bot (@Botname play)

prefix = "@mention"


// If you set this, it modifies the default game of the bot
// Set this to NONE to have no game
// Set this to DEFAULT to use the default game
// You can make the game "Playing X", "Listening to X", or "Watching X"
// where X is the title. If you don't include an action, it will use the
// default of "Playing"

game = "DEFAULT"


// If you set this, it will modify the default status of bot
// Valid values: ONLINE IDLE DND INVISIBLE

status = ONLINE


// If you set this to true, the bot will use a Google account to play YouTube tracks.
// This is only needed if you are experiencing issues with YouTube playback.
// Once enabled, instructions for login will be written to the console and DMs.
// DO NOT use your main Google account! Use an alternative account.

youtubeoauth2=false


// If you set this to true, the bot will list the title of the song it is currently playing in its
// "Playing" status. Note that this will ONLY work if the bot is playing music on ONE guild;
// if the bot is playing on multiple guilds, this will not work.

songinstatus=false


// If you set this, the bot will also use this prefix in addition to
// the one provided above

altprefix = "NONE"


// If you set these, it will change the various emojis

success = "ðŸŽ¶"
warning = "ðŸ’¡"
error = "ðŸš«"

// If you set this, you change the word used to view the help.
// For example, if you set the prefix to !! and the help to cmds, you would type
// !!cmds to see the help text

help = help


// If you set this, the "nowplaying" command will show youtube thumbnails
// Note: If you set this to true, the nowplaying boxes will NOT refresh
// This is because refreshing the boxes causes the image to be reloaded
// every time it refreshes.

npimages = false


// If you set this, the bot will not leave a voice channel after it finishes a queue.
// Keep in mind that being connected to a voice channel uses additional bandwith,
// so this option is not recommended if bandwidth is a concern.

stayinchannel = false


// This sets the maximum amount of seconds any track loaded can be. If not set or set
// to any number less than or equal to zero, there is no maximum time length. This time
// restriction applies to songs loaded from any source.

maxtime = 0

// This sets the maximum number of pages of songs that can be loaded from a YouTube
// playlist. Each page can contain up to 100 tracks. Playing a playlist with more
// pages than the maximum will stop loading after the provided number of pages.
// For example, if the max was set to 15 and a playlist contained 1850 tracks,
// only the first 1500 tracks (15 pages) would be loaded. By default, this is
// set to 10 pages (1000 tracks).

maxytplaylistpages = 10


// This sets the ratio of users that must vote to skip the currently playing song.
// Guild owners can define their own skip ratios, but this will be used if a guild
// has not defined their own skip ratio.

skipratio = 0.55


// This sets the amount of seconds the bot will stay alone on a voice channel until it
// automatically leaves the voice channel and clears the queue. If not set or set
// to any number less than or equal to zero, the bot won't leave when alone.

alonetimeuntilstop = 0


// This sets an alternative folder to be used as the Playlists folder
// This can be a relative or absolute path

playlistsfolder = "Playlists"


// By default, the bot will DM the owner if the bot is running and a new version of the bot
// becomes available. Set this to false to disable this feature.

// Changing this changes the lyrics provider
// Currently available providers: "A-Z Lyrics", "Genius", "MusicMatch", "LyricsFreak"
// At the time of writing, I would recommend sticking with A-Z Lyrics or MusicMatch,
// as Genius tends to have a lot of non-song results and you might get something 
// completely unrelated to what you want.
// If you are interested in contributing a provider, please see
// https://github.com/jagrosh/JLyrics

// Transforms are used to modify specific play inputs and convert them to different kinds of inputs
// These are quite complicated to use, and have limited use-cases, but in theory allow for rough
// whitelists or blacklists, roundabout loading from some sources, and customization of how things are
// requested.
//
// These are NOT EASY to set up, so if you want to use these, you'll need to look through the code 
// for how they work and what fields are needed. Also, it's possible this feature might get entirely
// removed in the future if I find a better way to do this.

transforms = {}


// If you set this to true, it will enable the eval command for the bot owner. This command
// allows the bot owner to run arbitrary code from the bot's account.
//
// WARNING:
// This command can be extremely dangerous. If you don't know what you're doing, you could
// cause horrific problems on your Discord server or on whatever computer this bot is running
// on. Never run this command unless you are completely positive what you are running.
//
// DO NOT ENABLE THIS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS DOES OR HOW TO USE IT
// IF SOMEONE ASKS YOU TO ENABLE THIS, THERE IS AN 11/10 CHANCE THEY ARE TRYING TO SCAM YOU
